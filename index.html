      <h2> hello, im hannan! </h2>
      <p>
        I'm a student at the <strong> University of California, Davis.</strong> Currently, I am pursuing a B.A in <strong> design </strong> and a B.S <strong> computer science. </strong> <br><br>
        I am a storyteller at heart. I love communicating narratives through illustrations, writing, and code
        Learning about people of different backgrounds and their stories excite me, and I try to design with a story in mind.
        <br><br>I am the incoming New Media Manager for the California Aggie.

      <h3><em> product design<br> 2017</em></h3>
      <p> This was a project that was done in my Des 001 Class with Dr. James Housefield.
        The goal of this project was to help design a product that was human-centered and focused
        on the prompt of “education”.<a href=project1.html>read more</a></p>

      <h3><em> product design<br> 2017-2018 </em> </h3>
      <p> This was an idea created for the “Big Bang” business competition held by UC Davis in 2017.
        It won one of the prizes. The idea behind this project was to incentivize learning life skills
        by rewarding users through a game-based progression system. <a href=project2.html>read more</a> </p>

      <h3> concept design<br> <em> 2017 </em> </h3>
      <p> This was a project created for the club “Design For America”. The final product was an item which
        would help people with visual or auditory impairments navigate the Unitrans system in the City of Davis.
         While we did not finish the project, the research done really showed me the design thinking process.

      <h3>web design<br><em> 2019 </em> </h3>
      <p> For my Interactive Media Class, DES 117, one of our projects was to create a blog. The topic had to be
        centered around the internet and technology. The blog topic I  chose was about image filters. In my blog
        posts,  I talked about  snapchat face-masks, instagram color-changers, and other topics in Computer Vision.
